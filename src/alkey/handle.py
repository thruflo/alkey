      Note that the implementation deletes members from the changed set the

      thread / process / client either sets the token or adds the member back to
      the set in between these two commands, as either the token is updated twice,
      which is fine, or the member is added to the set twice, which is fine, or
      removed immediately before it is removed, which is fine.
      
      The upshot of which is that there's no need to run the commands in a
      transaction, or (more importantly) to watch the changed key to make sure
      members aren't added to the set whilst the transaction is completed. This
      means we don't need to block redis / stop flushes from another client adding
      members to the set as we do this block operation.
